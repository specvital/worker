# Conversation Handoff Summary

## Required Output

This command generates and saves a markdown file. Always:

1. Analyze the conversation
2. Create the file using Write tool
3. Save to: `./handoff-summary-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

The purpose is file creation, not just information display.

Generate comprehensive summary for AI agent handoff: $ARGUMENTS

## What This Command Does

This command creates a detailed markdown summary of our entire conversation, structured to enable another AI agent to seamlessly continue the work. The summary includes:

- **Context and Background**: Initial problem statement and user requirements
- **Work Completed**: Detailed list of all tasks accomplished
- **Technical Decisions**: Key architectural and implementation choices made
- **Code Changes**: Summary of files modified, created, or refactored
- **Current State**: Where the project stands now
- **Pending Items**: Any unfinished tasks or future considerations
- **Important Notes**: Critical information for continuation

## Output Format

The command generates a markdown file with the following structure:

```markdown
# Project Handoff Summary

```

## Key Sections Explained

### User Context

Captures communication preferences, technical level, and any specific requirements mentioned during conversation

### Technical Decisions

Documents why certain approaches were chosen over others, preventing future agents from undoing intentional choices

### Code Examples

Includes actual code snippets for complex implementations, ensuring the next agent understands the implementation style

### Important Warnings

Highlights any critical information that could cause issues if not known (e.g., "Don't modify X because it will break Y")

### Related Files

Lists all files that were created or modified, with brief descriptions of their purpose and changes

## Notes for the Next Agent

The summary will include:

- Conversation tone and style preferences
- Any tools or commands created during the session
- User's stated preferences (e.g., no emojis, no conventional commit prefixes)
- Current working directory and environment setup
- Any external dependencies or API keys mentioned

## Output Options

The command will:

- Generate a comprehensive markdown file
- Save it as `handoff-summary-[timestamp].md`
- Display the content for review
- Optionally include conversation transcript excerpts for critical decisions

This ensures perfect continuity when switching between AI agents or resuming work after a break.
